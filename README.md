Analyze the content of HTTP responses to understand the data being returned by the server. This includes HTML content, JavaScript, CSS, images, JSON, etc. Pay attention to sensitive information, such as authentication tokens or personal data, which should be handled securely.
1. Install and Configure Burp Suite:
 Download and install Burp Suite from the official website.
 Launch Burp Suite and configure your browser to use it as a proxy.
2. Start a New Project:
 Open Burp Suite and create a new project.
 Specify the scope of your testing, including target URLs and domains.
3. Proxy Setup:
In Burp Suite, navigate to the Proxy tab and ensure that the Intercept is turned off initially.
Check that the proxy listener is running on the specified port (usually 8080).
4. Enable Proxy in Browser:
Configure your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy.
This allows Burp Suite to intercept and analyze the HTTP traffic between your browser and the web server.
5. Capture HTTP Traffic:
With the proxy running and the browser configured, start browsing the target website or application.
Burp Suite will capture all HTTP requests and responses passing through the proxy.
6.Intercept Requests and Responses:
If you want to inspect or modify specific requests or responses, enable Intercept in Burp Suite.
This allows you to pause the traffic flow and manually review each request and response before forwarding it.
7. Analyze Requests and Responses:
Navigate to the Proxy â†’ HTTP history tab in Burp Suite.
Here, you can view a list of all intercepted HTTP requests and responses.
Clicking on any entry will display detailed information, including request and response headers, status codes, and content.
8. Inspect Status Codes:
Look at the status codes of the HTTP responses to identify any errors or issues.
Common status codes include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), etc.
Investigate any unexpected status codes to understand potential problems with the application.
9. Review Headers:
Examine the headers of both requests and responses.
Headers provide important metadata about the communication between the client and server, such as content type, cookies, user-agent, etc.
Check for any unusual or missing headers that may indicate security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
10. Inspect Content:
Analyze the content of HTTP responses to understand the data being returned by the server.
This includes HTML content, JavaScript, CSS, images, JSON, etc.
Pay attention to sensitive information, such as authentication tokens or personal data, which should be handled securely.
11. Repeat and Test Different Scenarios:
Explore different functionalities of the application to capture a variety of HTTP traffic.
